-------

##Self-summary
I was born and raised in a green suburb of London called Richmond. 
I spent my summers in Antibes, France and lived for one year in 
Bilbao, Spain. 

At university I discovered the fruits of independent 
learning and often studied and attended classes beyond the scope of my course.
For example, I attended machine learning taught by [Gavin Brown & Co](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/). 
I also enjoyed taking part in a number of 
societies and even created my own, [University of Manchester Slackline
Society](http://www.facebook.com/groups/uomslackline).

I like to work on things that I can be proud of. I
think its important to like what you do and work for things you
believe in. I also think its important to balance work with sport and adventure.

I recently (December 2013) moved to Brazil for three reasons (no particular
order):

1. Become fluent in Portuguese. I am half-Brazilian and it pains me that
I never learned Portuguese at home, even though I learned French growing 
up and speak Spanish fairly well.
2. Meet my Brazilian family!
3. Because I can! Travel broadens the mind.

Whilst here I would like to work in a Brazilian company. I have a few preferences
for types of company and positions but there are two important criteria that I am 
looking for. Firstly, the company has a good ethos (ie the employees 
work because they enjoy what they do, not just for money). Secondly, the company is
not set in its ways and celebrates creativity and innovation. (If you satisfy 
these please contact <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>).

##Interests

###Coding
I spend a lot of my free time making fun things and learning new technologies.
I've talked quite a lot about coding in the other sections so I won't repeat myself.

###Slackline
Inspired by this [incredible video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) 
I was determined to begin slacklining. 
In October 2011 I bought my first slackline and got into the slackline scene
in Bilbao, Spain. Not long after I competed in slackline competitions such as
in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCaj_6_kxnE) and that [video](http://vimeo.com/68002964). 
More recently I starred in a [music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrFMbNH-w9I).

###Music
I am a music snob and don't like commercial/chart music (for the vast majority). I prefer music from
all over the world and enjoy hearing different sounds. Here is a 
[small playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PLjOro5tPjsWpOXHH6jASK5eqWJdF1cV-d) I
put together, it features Cuban, Brazilian, Arabic, 
African music and some others.

###Coffee
Huge fan of coffee. I am interested in how brewing parameters (e.g. extraction time,
pressure, heat) can affect the taste and particularly strength of the coffee.

###Learning
I love learning new things and I am currently having a lot of fun trying out gymnastics.
Hopefully learn some capoeira whilst in Brazil, as well as Forró being on my list.

###Cycling
I think cycling is simply a better way to travel. Indeed I like cycling 
so much I have travelled thousands of miles through europe on my bike.
This illustrates my point nicely:
<img style="display:block;height:630px" src="/static/img/cycling-is-better.jpg"/>


----------
##Inspiring things
I have wanted to make this list for a while but never got round to it.
The internet can be an inspiring place sometimes. Here are a few things 
which have inspired me:

1. [Regrets of the dying](http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html).
Stories of a palliative care nurse who asked her patients if they had any regrets 
before they were about to die. Here are the top 5.
2. [TED](http://www.ted.com/) is an amazing place to fnd inspiring people and this is an 
[amazing guy](http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_how_i_harnessed_the_wind.html).
3. [Here is somebody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6CVj5IQkzk) who really challenges 
conventional thinking and I really respect as a
visionary. He was a prominent feature in my decision to study neuroscience.
4. I learned programming online and stumbled on some C lectures taught by the exceptional 
Richard Buckland. I was enthused by his passion for computer science and probably 
would not have pursued programming until now if it was not for him. Here is 
[a less technical lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq9tjwFI4y0)
he made which I believe is relevant to all.
5. As mentioned above [here is the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) 
which inspired me to start slacklining. Also see 
[this amazing one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmuMSnT9ISU).
