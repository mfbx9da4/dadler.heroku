##Inspiring things
Not particularly related to my CV but I have wanted to make this list for a while 
and never got round to it.
The internet can be an inspiring place sometimes. Here are a few things 
which have inspired me:

1. Stories of a palliative care nurse who asked her patients if they had any regrets 
before they were about to die. Here are the top 5 [regrets of the dying](http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html).
2. [TED](http://www.ted.com/) is an amazing place to fnd inspiring people and this is an 
[amazing guy](http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_how_i_harnessed_the_wind.html).
3. [Here is somebody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6CVj5IQkzk) who really challenges 
conventional thinking and I really respect as a
visionary. He was a prominent feature in my decision to study neuroscience.
4. I learned programming online and stumbled on some C lectures taught by the exceptional 
Richard Buckland. I was enthused by his passion for computer science and probably 
would not have pursued programming until now if it was not for him. Here is 
[a less technical lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq9tjwFI4y0)
he made which I believe is relevant to all.
5. As mentioned above [here is the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) 
which inspired me to start slacklining. Also see 
[this amazing one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmuMSnT9ISU).
6. A fantastic Brazilian neuroscientist and one of the most [fascinating experiment]().
