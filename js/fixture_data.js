      'description': 'A breif summary of my background, ethos and what I get up to when I\'m not coding.',
      'content': "-------\n\n##Self-summary\nI was born and raised in a green suburb of London called Richmond. \nI spent my summers in Antibes, France and lived for one year in \nBilbao, Spain. \n\nAt university I discovered the fruits of independent \nlearning and often studied and attended classes beyond the scope of my course.\nFor example, I attended machine learning taught by [Gavin Brown & Co](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/). \nI also enjoyed taking part in a number of \nsocieties and even created my own, [University of Manchester Slackline\nSociety](http://www.facebook.com/groups/uomslackline).\n\nI like to work on things that I can be proud of. I\nthink its important to like what you do and work for things you\nbelieve in. I also think its important to balance work with sport and adventure.\n\nI recently (December 2013) moved to Brazil for three reasons (no particular\norder):\n\n1. Become fluent in Portuguese. I am half-Brazilian and it pains me that\nI never learned Portuguese at home, even though I learned French growing \nup and speak Spanish fairly well.\n2. Meet my Brazilian family!\n3. Because I can! Travel broadens the mind.\n\nWhilst here I would like to work in a Brazilian company. I have a few preferences\nfor types of company and positions but there are two important criteria that I am \nlooking for. Firstly, the company has a good ethos (ie the employees \nwork because they enjoy what they do, not just for money). Secondly, the company is\nnot set in its ways and celebrates creativity and innovation. (If you satisfy \nthese please contact <i class=\"fa fa-smile-o\"></i>).\n\n\n<hr>\n##Interests\n\n###Coding\nI spend a lot of my free time making fun things and learning new technologies.\nI've talked quite a lot about coding in the other sections so I won't repeat myself.\n\n###Slackline\nInspired by this [incredible video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) \nI was determined to begin slacklining. \nIn October 2011 I bought my first slackline and got into the slackline scene\nin Bilbao, Spain. Not long after I competed in slackline competitions such as\nin this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCaj_6_kxnE) and that [video](http://vimeo.com/68002964). \nMore recently I starred in a [music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrFMbNH-w9I).\n\n###Music\nI am a music snob and don't like commercial/chart music (for the vast majority). I prefer music from\nall over the world and enjoy hearing different sounds. Here is a \n[small playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PLjOro5tPjsWpOXHH6jASK5eqWJdF1cV-d) I\nput together, it features Cuban, Brazilian, Arabic, \nAfrican music and some others.\n\n###Coffee\nHuge fan of coffee. I am interested in how brewing parameters (e.g. extraction time,\npressure, heat) can affect the taste and particularly strength of the coffee.\n\n###Learning\nI love learning new things and I am currently having a lot of fun trying out gymnastics.\nHopefully learn some capoeira whilst in Brazil, as well as Forró being on my list.\n\n###Cycling\nI think cycling is simply a better way to travel. Indeed I like cycling \nso much I have travelled thousands of miles through europe on my bike.\nThis illustrates my point nicely:\n<img style=\"display:block;height:630px\" src=\"img/cycling-is-better.jpg\"/>\n\n\n----------\n##Inspiring things\nI have wanted to make this list for a while but never got round to it.\nThe internet can be an inspiring place sometimes. Here are a few things \nwhich have inspired me:\n\n1. [Regrets of the dying](http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html).\nStories of a palliative care nurse who asked her patients if they had any regrets \nbefore they were about to die. Here are the top 5.\n2. [TED](http://www.ted.com/) is an amazing place to fnd inspiring people and this is an \n[amazing guy](http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_how_i_harnessed_the_wind.html).\n3. [Here is somebody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6CVj5IQkzk) who really challenges \nconventional thinking and I really respect as a\nvisionary. He was a prominent feature in my decision to study neuroscience.\n4. I learned programming online and stumbled on some C lectures taught by the exceptional \nRichard Buckland. I was enthused by his passion for computer science and probably \nwould not have pursued programming until now if it was not for him. Here is \n[a less technical lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq9tjwFI4y0)\nhe made which I believe is relevant to all.\n5. As mentioned above [here is the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) \nwhich inspired me to start slacklining. Also see \n[this amazing one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmuMSnT9ISU).\n"
