###[Rhythmludus (incomplete)](http://rhythmludus.appspot.com/game?song=song_one_track_low.xml&back=file.mp3)
- Side project with my friend [Jessie](https://github.com/jessie93).
- HTML5 canvas guitar hero-like game for playing rhythms with keys. Also comes with 
a rhythm composer. Rhythms are stored as XML and site uses python and google app engine for 
backend.
- The intention is to teach users rhythm by playing the game.
- *Why?:* I have been trying to learn how to play an Egyptian hand drum 
called a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abUAzg9PR9Y">darbuka</a>. 
I found it hard to learn new rhythms, harder to make up new rhythms and 
hardest to play in time with other people or songs. I thought a guitar-hero 
like interface may simplify the learning process and so we started coding ...

###Artiﬁcial neuron-astrocyte network
- Final year computational neuroscience project.
- This project involved the development of one of the first ever computational models of a learning neuron-astrocyte network.
- *Background:* Contrary to popular belief, neurons are not the only 
cells in the brain which perform learning and cognitive functions. 
For decades, artificial intelligence researchers have made computational models 
of neural networks but failed to acknowledge the role of astrocytes. 
My work presents a novel model of neuron-astrocyte networks and challenges 
one of the pioneering neuron-astrocyte network models. If you are interested in a more
comprehensive background information on the topic please read [this essay](/files/lit_review.pdf) I wrote.
- *Why?:* While on placement in Spain, I was researching the role of astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease. 
I was fascinated by the fact that their abundance and diversity is proportional to intelligence and yet 
their role in intelligence is largely overlooked.

At the time I was also curious about artificial intelligence (AI) and was intrigued to see 
how AI researchers had modelled astrocytes. Suprisingly, few researchers had made 
computational models of astrocytes, and so my project began.

###Google docs referencing system

##Self-summary
I was born and raised in a green suburb of London called Richmond. 
I spent my summers in Antibes, France and lived for one year in 
Bilbao, Spain. 

At university I discovered the fruits of independent 
learning and often studied and attended classes beyond the scope of my course.
For example, I attended machine learning taught by [Gavin Brown & Co](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/). 
I also enjoyed taking part in a number of 
societies and even created my own, [University of Manchester Slackline
Society](http://www.facebook.com/groups/uomslackline).

I like to work on things that I can be proud of. I
think its important to like what you do and work for things you
believe in. I also think its important to balance work with sport and adventure.

I recently (December 2013) moved to Brazil for three reasons (no particular
order):

1. Become fluent in Portuguese. I am half-Brazilian and it pains me that
I never learned Portuguese at home, even though I learned French growing 
up and speak Spanish fairly well.
2. Meet my Brazilian family!
3. Because I can! Travel broadens the mind.

Whilst here I hope to find a fun place to work. Ideally situated in Rio
De Janeiro but I am open to other offers. I would like to work in a 
company with an innovative business idea, a strong company ethos and 
a highly creative environment.


Note: I am eligibile to work without 
a special visa since I have a Brazilian passport. My Portuguese is now at 
a sufficient level for written and communication. Feel free to contact me 
<i style="background-color: gold; border-radius:100%; font-size:1.5em" class="fa  fa-smile-o"></i>).

##Interests

###<i style="color:rgb(255, 163, 0)" class="fa fa-code"></i> Coding
I spend a lot of my free time making fun things and learning new technologies.
I originally started learning to code because of an ambititon to start an online 
business. The business came to fruition but I fell in love with coding and stuck 
with it.

###<i style="color:rgb(255, 163, 0)" class="fa fa-star"></i> Slackline
Inspired by this [incredible video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) 
I was determined to begin slacklining. 
In October 2011 I bought my first slackline and got into the slackline scene
in Bilbao, Spain. Not long after I competed in slackline competitions such as
in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCaj_6_kxnE) and that [video](http://vimeo.com/68002964). 
More recently I starred in a [music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrFMbNH-w9I).

###<i style="color:rgb(255, 163, 0)" class="fa fa-music"></i> Music
I am a self-confessed music snob. I don't like commercial/chart music (for the vast majority). 
I prefer music from eclectic sounds from all over the world. Here is a 
[small playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PLjOro5tPjsWpOXHH6jASK5eqWJdF1cV-d) I
threw together, it features Cuban, Brazilian, Arabic, 
African music and some others.

###<i style="color:rgb(255, 163, 0)" class="fa fa-coffee"></i> Coffee
Huge fan of coffee. I am interested in how brewing parameters (e.g. extraction time,
pressure, heat) can affect the taste and particularly strength of the coffee.

###<i style="color:rgb(255, 163, 0)" class="fa fa-book"></i> Learning
I love learning new things and I am currently having a lot of fun trying out gymnastics.
Hopefully learn some capoeira whilst in Brazil, as well as Forró being on my list. Also,
when I can I like to use online learning tools such as [coursera](http://coursera.org),
[udacity](http://udacity.com) and [duolingo](http://duolingo.com).

###<i style="color:rgb(255, 163, 0)" class="fa fa-globe"></i> Cycling
I think cycling is simply a better way to travel. Indeed I like cycling 
so much I have travelled thousands of miles through europe on my bike.
This illustrates my point nicely:

##Inspiring things
Not particularly related to my CV but I have wanted to make this list for a while 
and never got round to it.
The internet can be an inspiring place sometimes. Here are a few things 
which have inspired me:

1. Stories of a palliative care nurse who asked her patients if they had any regrets 
before they were about to die. Here are the top 5 [regrets of the dying](http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html).
2. [TED](http://www.ted.com/) is an amazing place to fnd inspiring people and this is an 
[amazing guy](http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_how_i_harnessed_the_wind.html).
3. [Here is somebody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6CVj5IQkzk) who really challenges 
conventional thinking and I really respect as a
visionary. He was a prominent feature in my decision to study neuroscience.
4. I learned programming online and stumbled on some C lectures taught by the exceptional 
Richard Buckland. I was enthused by his passion for computer science and probably 
would not have pursued programming until now if it was not for him. Here is 
[a less technical lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq9tjwFI4y0)
he made which I believe is relevant to all.
5. As mentioned above [here is the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) 
which inspired me to start slacklining. Also see 
[this amazing one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmuMSnT9ISU).
6. Miguel Nicolelis is a fantastic Brazilian neuroscientist and here 
is a [ground-breaking experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR_LBcZg_84).
