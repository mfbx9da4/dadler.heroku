Also comes with \na rhythm composer. Rhythms are stored as XML and site uses python and google app engine for \nbackend.\n- The intention is to teach users rhythm by playing the game.\n- *Why?:* I have been trying to learn how to play an Egyptian hand drum \ncalled a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abUAzg9PR9Y\">darbuka</a>. \nI found it hard to learn new rhythms, harder to make up new rhythms and \nhardest to play in time with other people or songs.

If you are interested in a more\ncomprehensive background information on the topic please read [this essay](/files/lit_review.pdf) I wrote.\n- *Why?:* While on placement in Spain, I was researching the role of astrocytes in Alzheimer's disease. \nI was fascinated by the fact that their abundance and diversity is proportional to intelligence and yet \ntheir role in intelligence is largely overlooked.\n\nAt the time I was also curious about artificial intelligence (AI) and was intrigued to see \nhow AI researchers had modelled astrocytes. Suprisingly, few researchers had made \ncomputational models of astrocytes, and so my project began. \n\nspan-date[Autumn 2012]\n###Google docs referencing system\n- Small project but neat solution. Using google apps script.\n\n###Project Euler\n- I love a good PE problem from time-to-time.\n- My username is `mfbx9da4`, you can see my progress by adding me as a friend on the site.\n\n---------------\n###Find me on <a href=\"https://github.com/mfbx9da4/\" class=\"fa fa-2x fa-github\"></a>\n"

      'content': "-------\n\n##Self-summary\nI was born and raised in a green suburb of London called Richmond. \nI spent my summers in Antibes, France and lived for one year in \nBilbao, Spain. \n\nAt university I discovered the fruits of independent \nlearning and often studied and attended classes beyond the scope of my course.\nFor example, I attended machine learning taught by [Gavin Brown & Co](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/). \nI also enjoyed taking part in a number of \nsocieties and even created my own, [University of Manchester Slackline\nSociety](http://www.facebook.com/groups/uomslackline).\n\nI like to work on things that I can be proud of. I\nthink its important to like what you do and work for things you\nbelieve in. I also think its important to balance work with sport and adventure.\n\nI recently (December 2013) moved to Brazil for three reasons (no particular\norder):\n\n1. Become fluent in Portuguese. I am half-Brazilian and it pains me that\nI never learned Portuguese at home, even though I learned French growing \nup and speak Spanish fairly well.\n2. Meet my Brazilian family!\n3. Because I can! Travel broadens the mind.\n\nWhilst here I hope to find a fun place to work. Ideally situated in Rio\nDe Janeiro but I am open to other offers. I would like to work in a \ncompany with an innovative business idea, a strong company ethos and \na highly creative environment.\n\n\nNote: I am eligibile to work without \na special visa since I have a Brazilian passport. My Portuguese is now at \na sufficient level for written and communication. Feel free to contact me \n<i style=\"background-color: gold; border-radius:100%; font-size:1.5em\" class=\"fa  fa-smile-o\"></i>).\n\n\n<hr>\n##Interests\n\n###<i style=\"color:rgb(255, 163, 0)\" class=\"fa fa-code\"></i> Coding\nI spend a lot of my free time making fun things and learning new technologies.\nI originally started learning to code because of an ambititon to start an online \nbusiness. The business came to fruition but I fell in love with coding and stuck \nwith it.\n\n###<i style=\"color:rgb(255, 163, 0)\" class=\"fa fa-star\"></i> Slackline\nInspired by this [incredible video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) \nI was determined to begin slacklining. \nIn October 2011 I bought my first slackline and got into the slackline scene\nin Bilbao, Spain. Not long after I competed in slackline competitions such as\nin this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCaj_6_kxnE) and that [video](http://vimeo.com/68002964). \nMore recently I starred in a [music video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrFMbNH-w9I).\n\n###<i style=\"color:rgb(255, 163, 0)\" class=\"fa fa-music\"></i> Music\nI am a self-confessed music snob. I don't like commercial/chart music (for the vast majority). \nI prefer music from eclectic sounds from all over the world. Here is a \n[small playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?feature=edit_ok&list=PLjOro5tPjsWpOXHH6jASK5eqWJdF1cV-d) I\nthrew together, it features Cuban, Brazilian, Arabic, \nAfrican music and some others.\n\n###<i style=\"color:rgb(255, 163, 0)\" class=\"fa fa-coffee\"></i> Coffee\nHuge fan of coffee. I am interested in how brewing parameters (e.g. extraction time,\npressure, heat) can affect the taste and particularly strength of the coffee.\n\n###<i style=\"color:rgb(255, 163, 0)\" class=\"fa fa-book\"></i> Learning\nI love learning new things and I am currently having a lot of fun trying out gymnastics.\nHopefully learn some capoeira whilst in Brazil, as well as Forró being on my list. Also,\nwhen I can I like to use online learning tools such as [coursera](http://coursera.org),\n[udacity](http://udacity.com) and [duolingo](http://duolingo.com).\n\n###<i style=\"color:rgb(255, 163, 0)\" class=\"fa fa-globe\"></i> Cycling\nI think cycling is simply a better way to travel. Indeed I like cycling \nso much I have travelled thousands of miles through europe on my bike.\nThis illustrates my point nicely:\n<img style=\"display:block;height:630px;margin: 0 auto;margin: 23px auto;\nbox-shadow: 4px 4px 21px 1px black;\" src=\"/static/img/cycling-is-better.jpg\"/>\n\n\n----------\n##Inspiring things\nNot particularly related to my CV but I have wanted to make this list for a while \nand never got round to it.\nThe internet can be an inspiring place sometimes. Here are a few things \nwhich have inspired me:\n\n1. Stories of a palliative care nurse who asked her patients if they had any regrets \nbefore they were about to die. Here are the top 5 [regrets of the dying](http://www.inspirationandchai.com/Regrets-of-the-Dying.html).\n2. [TED](http://www.ted.com/) is an amazing place to fnd inspiring people and this is an \n[amazing guy](http://www.ted.com/talks/william_kamkwamba_how_i_harnessed_the_wind.html).\n3. [Here is somebody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6CVj5IQkzk) who really challenges \nconventional thinking and I really respect as a\nvisionary. He was a prominent feature in my decision to study neuroscience.\n4. I learned programming online and stumbled on some C lectures taught by the exceptional \nRichard Buckland. I was enthused by his passion for computer science and probably \nwould not have pursued programming until now if it was not for him. Here is \n[a less technical lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq9tjwFI4y0)\nhe made which I believe is relevant to all.\n5. As mentioned above [here is the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55lfGEjnjoc) \nwhich inspired me to start slacklining. Also see \n[this amazing one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmuMSnT9ISU).\n6. Miguel Nicolelis is a fantastic Brazilian neuroscientist and here \nis a [ground-breaking experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR_LBcZg_84).\n"
